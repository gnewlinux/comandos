mkdir /mnt/debian-dvd
Now we need to add a /etc/fstab entry so the ISO image will be mounted every time we boot the system. Open up /etc/fstab and add a following line:

/mnt/storage/iSO/debian-i386-DVD-1.iso /mnt/debian-dvd/ udf,iso9660 loop 0 0
Once done we can include this local repository into /etc/apt/sources.list. Open up /etc/apt/sources.list file and add:

NOTE: change wheezy with your version.

deb file:/mnt/debian-dvd/ wheezy main contrib
All done. What remains is to mount the actual image:

# mount /mnt/debian-dvd/
and update apt's depository:

# apt-get update
